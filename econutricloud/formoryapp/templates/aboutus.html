        <h3>Our Story</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Our journey was fueled by a dream to bridge the gap between homemade comfort and modern convenience. In today’s busy world, we realized that many families and professionals were missing out on nutritious, hygienic meals because of time constraints. That’s when FormoryKitchen stepped in—to deliver not just food, but an experience that feels like home.<br>
        Over the years, we’ve built strong relationships with local farmers and suppliers to ensure every ingredient is fresh, natural, and responsibly sourced. Each recipe has been thoughtfully crafted, balancing tradition with innovation, so every bite carries the warmth of home and the excitement of discovery.<br>
        From delivering single meals to catering large gatherings, our commitment has always remained the same—to serve food that people can trust and enjoy with their loved ones. What makes us proud is not just the meals we create, but the community of loyal customers who continue to share their lives and stories with us.<br>
        Today, FormoryKitchen is more than just a kitchen—it’s a family built on values of love, hygiene, and care. And as we grow, we remain true to our roots: spreading happiness one meal at a time.</p>

        <h3>Our Hygiene Promise</h3>
      </div>
      <p>We follow a “clean kitchen, clean food” philosophy. Our chefs and staff undergo regular hygiene training, wear protective gear, and work in a safe, sterilized environment. From washing vegetables to handling raw ingredients, each step is carried out with utmost care to prevent contamination.<br>
        We maintain strict safety checks before, during, and after food preparation. Fresh ingredients are sourced daily, carefully inspected, and stored under the right conditions to retain their natural flavor and nutrition. All cooking utensils and surfaces are sanitized multiple times a day to ensure a germ-free workspace.<br>
        Packaging is another area where we hold ourselves to high standards. We use eco-friendly, high-quality, and food-grade packaging that keeps your meal safe, fresh, and intact until it reaches your table.<br>
        At FormoryKitchen, hygiene isn’t just a practice—it’s a promise. A promise that every meal you enjoy is not only delicious but also safe, clean, and nourishing for you and your family.</p>
