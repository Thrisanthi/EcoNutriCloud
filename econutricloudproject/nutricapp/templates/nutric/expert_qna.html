      <h2>Basic Nutrition</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">
          <span>Q: How much of a nutrient is too much?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Nutrients are essential for health, but too much of certain vitamins and minerals can actually be harmful. This is known as nutrient toxicity.
            Each nutrient has a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) (the daily amount you need for good health) and a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) (the maximum daily amount unlikely to cause harm).
            For example:
            Vitamin C: RDA ~75–90 mg/day, UL = 2,000 mg/day. Too much may cause diarrhea or stomach upset.
            Vitamin D: RDA ~600 IU/day, UL = 4,000 IU/day. Excess may cause calcium buildup in blood.
            Iron: RDA 8–18 mg/day (varies), UL = 45 mg/day. Too much can damage organs.
            Getting too many nutrients usually happens from supplements, not from food.
